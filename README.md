# Simplechat Webclient
## About
This is a simple website where user can send message to all other users. I made this to learn more about react.
There is only one 'chatroom', so users can't send messages privately to other users.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zein3/simplechat-client.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3a. Run the website
```bash
npm start
```
3b. Or if you want to test the website over lan
```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```
